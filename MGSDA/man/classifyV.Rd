\title{
Classification for MGSDA
}
\description{
Classifies observations in the test set using the supplied matrix of canonical vectors V and the training set.
}
\usage{
classifyV(Xtrain, Ytrain, Xtest, V, prior = T)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Xtrain}{
A Nxp data matrix; N observations on the rows and p features on the columns.
}
  \item{Ytrain}{
A N vector containing the group labels. Should be coded as 1,2,...,G, where G is the number of groups.
}
  \item{Xtest}{
A Mxp data matrix; M test observations on the rows and p features on the columns.
}
  \item{V}{
A pxr matrix of canonical vectors that is used to classify observations.
}
  \item{prior}{
A logical indicating whether to put larger weights to the groups of larger size; the default value is TRUE.
}

### Example 1
# generate training data
n=10
p=100
G=3
ytrain=rep(1:G,each=n)
set.seed(1)
xtrain=matrix(rnorm(p*n*G),n*G,p)
# find V
V=dLDA(xtrain,ytrain,lambda=0.1)
sum(rowSums(V)!=0)
# generate test data
m=20
set.seed(3)
xtest=matrix(rnorm(p*m),m,p)
# perform classification
ytest=classifyV(xtrain,ytrain,xtest,V)
